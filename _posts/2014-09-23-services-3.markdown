title: Data Visualization\Dimension Reduction

  We have an simple algorithm to achieve data visualization/dimension reduction: 
  The left figure is the original data point, they are roughly following a spiral structure.
  In the right figure, we summarize it as one dimensional feature, (note the colors of the points
  corresponds to the colors in the original data in the left figure)
  determined by its relation to nearby points in the more aligned structure (right figure)
