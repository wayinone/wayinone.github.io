title: Prototype Learning--Generalized K-means
description: |
---
   The minimizer to the loss function of K-means (an NP-hard problem) finds reference points 
   to summarize data (unsupervisedly), we generalized it to find 
   "linear structures" (like lines in the left figure) to summarize data. 
   However, direct generalizing the idea of K-means algorithm is NOT working.
   Instead, we characterize a property of the minimizer of the loss function 
   and found an algorithm that approximate it really well.
