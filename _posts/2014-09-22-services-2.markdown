   The minimizer to the loss function of K-means finds reference points 
   to summarize data (unsupervisedly), we generalized it to find 
   "linear structures" (like lines in the left figure) to summarize data. 
   However, direct generalizing the idea of K-means algorithm is NOT working.
   Instead, we characterize a property of the minimizer of the loss function 
   (which is already NP hard for K-means) and found an algorithm that approximate it really well.
