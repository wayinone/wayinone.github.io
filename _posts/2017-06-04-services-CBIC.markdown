title: Toward the Maximum Compression Rate
description: |
---
  We developed a lossless image compression algorithm that have
  analytic guarantee. When context size is getting bigger, our algorithm 
  reaches the optimal compression rate a.e. under very light assumptions. 
  We actually don't need a lot of context size to outperform CALIC 
  algorithm, one of the best scheme so far. [Continue Reading...](/CBIC)
