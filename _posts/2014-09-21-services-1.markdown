title: Toward the Minimum Compression Rate
description: |
---
  We developed a lossless image compression algorithm that have
  analytic guarantee: when context size is getting bigger, we will
  reach the optimal compression rate. 
  We actually don't need a lot of context size to outperform CALIC 
  algorithm, as our figure suggest.
