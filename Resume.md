## Papers
  * W.-Y. Wang and S. Geman, [Comparison Based Image Compression.](/CBIC) In progress. 		
	* A novel lossless image compression scheme with analytic performance guarantees 
	* Outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in bit-per-pixel results
	* Implemented with Amazon cloud (EC2) parallel computing (in C and Python) on 80 million image patches (about 3.6GB)		

  * W.-Y. Wang and S. Geman, [Robust Generalized Clustering.](/RRA)  In progress.
	*  A highly robust unsupervised data clustering algorithm which fits multiple structures (even when data is 70% of corrupted) 
	* Approximating an NP-hard problem with a modified backward selection procedure
	* Implemented in C and Python (by ctypes module)
	
  * W.-Y. Wang and S. Geman, [Clustering to Shapes.](/PSA)  In progress.
	* An iterative PCA method for clustering high dimensional data into descriptive manifolds
