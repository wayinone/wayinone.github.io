## Summary ##
* Seeking a data scientist / Machine Learning Engineer position in which I would contribute to the success of
a business
* Data Schience Tech Lead in Wayfair, specialized in product matching and classification.
* 5 years of experience of scalable solutions and ML pipeline construction
* Applied Mathematics Ph.D.

## Technical Skills
* Machine Learning 
  * Classification, Regression, Deep Learning, NLP (Fasttext, CRF)
* Programming 
  * Python(numpy, keras, sklearn, pandas, airflow, kedro, pyspark)
* Database 
  * MSSQL, Vertica, Hive, Big Query

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AT WAYFAIR LLC.
* Product Match
  * Matching 60M Wayfair’s products against 1.1B crawled products in the market
  * Discovering a business rule by analyzing previous matched data, which find 85% of new matches (8M of match
pairs) in 30 min, where previous method will take 3 years
  * Developing a 2-staged machine learning model for white-labeled products that has recall of 95% at 20% false
positive rate with Spark ML and Scala
  * Constructing a scalable ML matching pipeline (for white-label products) that can finish entire product matching
process in 6 days
  * Matching model is regularly retrained with automated evaluation process to ensure safe deployment
  * Increasing existing matches by 300% and enabling analysis of market share, selection gap, and pricing
* Product Classification
  * Classifying entire catalog (60M Wayfair products and 1.1B crawled competitor products) into 800+ Wayfair
classes within 2 hours
  * Achieving 90% accuracy with deep learning model
  * Automated retraining and evaluating to prevent model degradation
* Manufacturer Normalization
  * Normalizing different manufacturer synonyms, e.g. "HP", "Hewlett-Packard", and "Hewlett Packard", are
alias of the same manufacturer and should be normalized together
  * Normalizing 129K distinctive manufacturer names into 10K manufacturers, which covers 97% of crawled data
  * Clean and accurate result impacting many aspects company-wide, fueling analysis like product gaps, MSRP
estimation, and product matching projects
* Part Number Extraction
  * Extracting part numbers from 130M competitor’s product name and description
  * Utilizing a conditional random field model to achieve 95% precision
* Optimal Threshold Determination with Bayesian Methods
  * Estimating match pair suggestions accuracy by the feedback look from human validation, and utilize Bayesian
statistics to obtain a robust result
  * Automatically choosing optimal threshold for different classes of products, and improve overall accuracy by
3%, corresponding to 30K+ hours of labor saving
* Code Standardization
  * Modifying an open-source template (kedro) to standardize team’s code to ensure production grade of coding
from begining, allieviating Data Scientists the burden of common infrastrcuture burden like Jupyter Notebook,
Spark environment, and code testing.
  * The first team in Wayfair to advocate the benefit of the code standardization effort with end to end execution
  * Speed up develop to production velocity by 200% when launching a new ML pipeline, compared to similar
projects carried by the other team
  * Enabling the separation of Engineering and data science work, leading to the maximum efficiency of the team
